# Bootstrap Theme is used for creating Geeklabel as advised

1. This is the source for the the new Drupal 7 site hosted at http://iitian.me/geek
2. The theme was created from Drupal 7 Bootstrap theme
3. Time taken: Roughly 15 hours. It took time to understand and find the dependency files of the Bootstrap template. Usually, it is straight forward but this Drupal bootstrap template is segregated into many sub-parts.
4. The site is tested with the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. I couldn't test on Edge or IE11 but it should work there.
5. The site is also tested on iPhone 6s, Redmi Note 3 and Chrome's inbuilt mobile emulator. It is also tested on Tablets using an emulator and should work without any issues.
 
# Files Edited
1. Added 'css/style.css' and all the CSS override is written here
2. Installed Font-Awesome and jQuery Update module
3. Edited 'templates/system/page.tlp.php'

# Approach
1. The theme was extended from a Bootstrap-based parent theme
2. I've used Bootstrap classes wherever possible. All CSS is written in 'css/style.css'
3. Basic javascript is added in 'templates/system/page.tlp.php'
4. All images are in PNG as transparency is needed.
6. I've used Font-Awesome for the Arrow icons as that's part of Bootstrap and instructed in the DOC to use bootstrap. For the other theme (opencharity), I've used a custom font.
7. I've used the default bootstrap font. I couldn't get MuseoSans which isn't free.
